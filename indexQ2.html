    <p>Q1-justify-content</p>
    <p>Answer-
        Definition and Usage
        The justify-content property aligns the flexible container's items when the items do not use all available space
        <br>
        on the main-axis (horizontally). <br>
        <br>
        Tip: Use the align-items property to align the items vertically. <br>
        <br>
        Note: The justify-content property can also be used on a grid container to align grid items in the inline
        direction. For pages in English, inline direction is left to right and block direction is downward. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Q2-align-items</p>
    <p>Answer-
        With Definition and Usage <br>
        The align-items property specifies the default alignment for items inside a flexbox or grid container. <br>
        <br>
        In a flexbox container, the flexbox items are aligned on the cross axis, which is vertical by default (opposite
        <br>
        of flex-direction). <br>
        In a grid container, the grid items are aligned in the block direction. For pages in English, block direction is
        <br>
        downward and inline direction is left to right. <br>
        For this property to have any alignment effect, the items need available space around themsFelves in the <br>
        appropriate direction. <br>
        <br>
        Tip: Use the align-self property of each item to override the align-items property. <br>

    <p>Q3-Gap</p>
    <p>Answer-
        Definition and Usage <br>
        The gap property defines the size of the gap between the rows and between the columns in flexbox, grid or
        multi-column layout. It is a shorthand for the following properties: <br>

        row-gap <br>
        column-gap <br>
        Note: The gap property was formerly known as grid-gap. <br>
    </p>

    <p>Q4-Flex-diretion</p>
    <p>Answer-
        Definition and Usage <br>
The flex-direction property specifies the direction of the flexible items. <br>

Note: If the element is not a flexible item, the flex-direction property has no effect. <br>
    </P>
    <p>Q5-Flex-diretion</p>
    <p>Answer-
        Definition and Usage <br>
        The flex-wrap property specifies whether the flexible items should wrap or not.
        <br>
        Note: If the elements are not flexible items, the flex-wrap property has no effect.
